## rxjs
`switchMap`:
* Has a cancelling effect.
* Will cancel previous operations if something fails.
* Works well for "typeaheads" and autocomplete features

`mergeMap`:
* Will let previous operations finish if something fails.
* Can potentially cause memory leaks if inner observables are long lived.
* Works well if you want to flatten inner observables and control inner subscriptions.

## Random JS/TS
`map` vs `forEach`
* `forEach` excecutes an action (function, if, etc) once against each element in the array
* `map` creates a new array with the results of calling an action on each element in the array
* So, `map` eliminates the need to create a new array and `push` for each element if you are flattening an array of objects.
