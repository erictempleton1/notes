#### SSH 
`ssh` into a remote machine without the password means that you need to add the `id_rsa.pub` of the machine you are ssh'ing from to the `~/.ssh/authorized_hosts` file on the remote machine
* An easy way to do this is using `ssh-copy-id`
* For example `ssh-copy-id <username>@<remote host>`
* You can then run `ssh 'username@remote-host'` without the password
